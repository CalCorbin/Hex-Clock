# The HEX Clock

A clock that tells you what time it is and displays time as a color in hexadecimal. This is me showing off what I have learned in Javascript. The clock is in military time.
Since the clock is in military time it also happens to correspond with hex color codes- so whatever time it is, the background will take on the color that corresponds in hex.
